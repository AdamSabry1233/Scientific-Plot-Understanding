Scientific Plot Understanding Pipeline

This repository builds an end-to-end system for understanding scientific plots — from raw images to reconstructed data and semantic meaning.

The system is modular and designed to scale from synthetic training data to real-world plots.

What This Project Does

Given an image of a scientific plot, the system aims to:

Detect plot layout (where things are)

Read text (labels, ticks, legends)

Segment curves

Reconstruct numeric data

Understand the plot’s meaning

Pipeline Overview
Stage 0 — Dataset Engine (DONE)

Goal: Generate unlimited, perfectly labeled training data

Produces:

Diverse scientific plot images

Pixel-accurate bounding boxes

YOLO labels

Curve ground truth

Layout + text metadata

Output:

output/images/

output/labels/

output/ground_truth/ (rich JSON)

This stage feeds all future models.

Stage 1 — Layout Detection (YOLO) (DONE)

Goal: Find where elements are

YOLO detects:

Plot area

Legend

Axis-related regions

Input: plot image
Output: bounding boxes for layout elements

Stage 2 — OCR (Text Extraction) (IN PROGRESS)

Goal: Read plot text

OCR runs only on cropped regions:

X-axis label

Y-axis label

Tick values

Legend labels

Output example:

"x_label": "Time (s)"
"y_label": "Velocity"
"x_ticks": [-5, 0, 5, 10]
"legend_labels": ["Line 0", "Line 1"]

Stage 3 — Curve Segmentation

Goal: Identify curve pixels

Segmentation model outputs a binary mask of curve pixels inside the plot area.

Stage 4 — Pixel → Data Reconstruction

Goal: Convert pixels into numbers

Uses:

OCR axis scales

Curve mask

Coordinate mapping

Output:

[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]

Stage 5 — Semantic Understanding

Goal: Understand what the plot represents

Adds:

Plot type detection

Trend analysis

Regression / classification

Example outputs:

“Sine wave signal”

“Frequency ≈ 0.2 Hz”

“Overall increasing trend”
